              <p><b> Does your device have a bad ESN/IMEI?</b></p>
              <p>
                  An ESN/IMEI is associated with any device capable of connecting to a carrier's network. See how to locate the ESN/IMEI of your device <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. A bad ESN/IMEI can be due to many factors
                  including, but not limited to, a device (such as a phone, tablet, watch, etc.) currently being active on an account, reported Lost or Stolen, or with an unpaid balance due on the orginal owner's account.
              </p>
              <p>You can check the ESN/IMEI status of your device using <a href="https://swappa.com/esn" target="_blank">Swappa's check IMEI/ESN tool</a></p>
              <p>If your device is currently under a finance plan with any network carrier, ensure that it is paid off before selling it to us.</p>
              <p>
                  After paying off your device, unlock it from your carrier to get the best offer! We normally will use a third-party unlocking service to unlock a network sim-locked device at a cost. This cost will be deducted from your
                  offer if your device is sent to us with a network sim lock. Getting your carrier to unlock your device is really easy! Here is how to do it for all 4 major carriers:
              </p>
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 20px;">
                  <li><b>AT&amp;T:</b> Unlock your AT&amp;T device using <a href="https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/#/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T's online unlocking utility</a>.</li>
                  <li><b>Sprint:</b> Call Sprint on <b>1 (855) 639-4644</b> to request a device unlock.</li>
                  <li><b>T-mobile:</b> Call T-mobile on <b>1 (877) 746-0909</b> to request a device unlock.</li>
                  <li><b>Verizon:</b> Call verizon on <b>1 (888) 294-6804</b> to request a device unlock.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>If you’re unsure of the finance status of a device with an ESN/IMEI number, call your network carrier.</p>
              <p><b> Does your device have any security access locks?</b></p>
              <p>
                  Almost every modern device comes with a security access lock of some sort. Laptops have user login accounts, Android devices have Google Activation locks, Apple devices have iCloud locks etc. Be sure to sign out from all
                  accounts and remove all locks (if applicable to your device) before shipping to us.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Be advised that:</strong></p>
